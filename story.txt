You wake up in your apartment. The smell of smoke is burning your nostrils. 
You can hear faint screams and blaring sirens outside. You get up and look out the window.
Abandoned cars and dead mauled bodies are scoruing up and down the street. You can see distant buildings that are aflame with dark black 
smoke billowing from the tops. What happened?!

You rush to turn on your television. Every channel is on a loop with emergency broadcast announcement. It must be a terorist attack.
Shrieking begins to erupt outside of your door down the hall. One of your neighbors are in trouble.
You open the door and can see a large man with tattered clothes busting into one of the women's doors a few apartments over.

a) Attack the man
b) Run the opposite direction
